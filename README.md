# Uncommon HTML Errors and Quirks

This repository demonstrates some uncommon but potentially problematic errors in HTML code that might not be immediately obvious to beginners or even intermediate developers.  These examples highlight the importance of proper HTML structure and semantic correctness.

## Bugs

* **Using `<br>` inside `<p>`:**  This is often avoided for semantic reasons, even if browsers handle it.
* **Nested `<p>` tags:** Nesting paragraphs inside block-level elements (like divs) unexpectedly affects layout.
* **Unclosed Tags:** Missing closing tags cause unpredictable behavior and layout issues.
