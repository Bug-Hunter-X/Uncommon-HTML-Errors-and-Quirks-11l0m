<p>This is a common mistake:  Using a <code class="language-html">&lt;br&gt;</code> tag inside of a <code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag can sometimes lead to unexpected results and is often considered bad practice. While the browser might render it, it's semantically incorrect. Paragraphs are for text, and <code class="language-html">&lt;br&gt;</code> introduces line breaks, which breaks the semantic meaning of a paragraph.</p><p>Another uncommon but tricky error is unintentionally creating nested <code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;</code> tags inside other block elements.  For instance, if you have nested <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements with paragraphs inside, you can create issues with layout if you don't consider the implied block-level behavior.</p><p>A more subtle error is forgetting to close tags correctly.  Missing closing tags, especially in complex HTML documents, can cause unpredictable layout issues, and cause browsers to render pages in unexpected ways. For example, an unclosed <code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag can affect the layout of following elements.  Use a HTML validator to catch these issues.  </p>
